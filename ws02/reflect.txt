1. According to my understanding of the concept what i think about it is that whenever we use the copy operator , the data is duplicated from the original object to the destination object . this allocate memory and then copy each element which for sure takes times for the larger data.
where if i talk about the move operator it bascially transfers the memory to the destination . this is faster than the copy operator because here we are not doing each data individually.

2. In the TennisLog constructor i am reading the file using the getline keyword which allows me to get the full line one byone .
another thing what i think we can use is the cin statement or the bool variable to check whether the line havebeen read or not .

3. so in the steady_clock it represents the passage of time . it is mostly used for the durations and the intervals while the steady_clock is clock that represents the current time . this is used to get the current time.
